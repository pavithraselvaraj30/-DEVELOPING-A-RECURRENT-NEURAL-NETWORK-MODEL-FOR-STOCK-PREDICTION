 DEVELOPING A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR STOCK PREDICTION

## AIM

To develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for predicting stock prices using historical closing price data.

## THEORY

Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

STEP 1:
Load and normalize data, create sequences.

STEP 2:
Convert data to tensors and set up DataLoader.

STEP 3:
Define the RNN model architecture.

STEP 4:
Summarize, compile with loss and optimizer.

STEP 5:
Train the model with loss tracking.

STEP 6:
Predict on test data, plot actual vs. predicted prices.
